## Description
This repository contains the latex code for my mini-thesis which I undertook as part of my masters course in RWTH Aachen. The topic of the thesis is ***Semi-Analytical Approach - Virtual Control System Design and Loads Verification for a multi-body model of a bike***, and was carried out at the *Institut f√ºr Getriebetechnik, Maschinendynamik und Robotik* (IGMR).

## Acessing the final report
Refer to the file `Thesis.pdf` or my [projects website](https://average-engineer.github.io/Projects-Website-Ashutosh-Mukherjee/), for accessing the thesis in its final form.

## Running the latex script
The main executable script is `Thesis.tex`, while the various styles and packages used for this report can be found in `igm.sty` (prescribed latex template from IGMR).
